-[Vite]: We leverage Vite as our development environment for a fast and efficient development experience.
-[TaskManagement]: You can add new tasks with detailed descriptions, due dates, and priorities.
-[MarkAsCompleted]: Mark tasks as completed as you finish them to keep a clear track of your progress.
-[FiltersAndSearch]: We've implemented filters and a search function to help you find and organize your tasks effectively.
